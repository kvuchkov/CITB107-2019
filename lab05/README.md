# Lab 5 - Functions
In this lab, we explore how functions can help us structure our programs better, reduce code duplication and create abstractions.

## Exercise 1
Write a simple command line calculator that reads expressions from the standard input and prints the expression evaluation to the standard output. 

## Exercise 2
Write a program that reads 3 percentage values from the standard input. If an entered value is not a valid percentage, prompt the user again until a valid percentage (integer between 0 and 100) is provided.
