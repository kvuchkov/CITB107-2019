In this lab, we practice the basics of control flow statements in C++ - `if`, `else` and `while`.

## Exercise 1
Write a program that calculates the change a vending machine should return to a customer. The program reads the price of the selected product and the amount given by the customer as integers from the standard input stream and outputs the total change and a breakdown of units and counts for each unit of money.
